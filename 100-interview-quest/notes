1.what is the difference between const ,let & var?
Ans. const means constant,

let can change variable at any point(reassigning at any time) & for empty variable declearation.mutable variable
let a=10;
a=20;
o/p-20
let is block scope.

const cant change variable once its declared.for array we can push or pop the variable.but const change entire variables at once.
Immutable variable.
we cant do 
const a;

var is old way of declearing variable prior ES6.var is function scope,window object

var a=10;
a=30;
console.log(a);
